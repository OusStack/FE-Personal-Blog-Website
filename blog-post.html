            Software Engineering.</br>
            </strong></br>
          <p>
          Software Engineering is used by Software Development Companies and their engineers to carry out the development work and maintain the Software. Engineering discipline and Software Development are the key disciplines of Software.
        </p>
        <p>
        Engineering. Approaches, protocols, tools, and technologies are used as a part of the Engineering discipline. Software Development processes, programming languages, libraries, Application Programming Interfaces (API), project management tools, algorithms, and integration methodologies are applied as a part of Software Development. Both the constituents of Software Engineering complement and supplement each other and they are used for generic as well as bespoke Software Development.
        Here three definitions  are presented  which are as  follows:
        The path-breaking definition of Software Engineering is the establishment and use of sound engineering principles in order to obtain economically software that is reliable and works efficiently on real machines.
      </p>
      <p>
      Engineering as “the systematic design and development of Software products and the management of the Software process. Software Engineering has one of its primary objectives of production of programs that meet specification, and are demonstrably accurate, produced on time, and within budget.
      Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) defines Software Engineering as “the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of Software.”
      Now, Software Development has become quite popular but several misconceptions are also attached to it. These are seen at three levels–Software management level, Software customer level, and Software developer level. The myths are presented along with facts so that the myths can be removed. It may be noted that Software Development becomes Software Engineering if development is done using well-defined techniques in an organized way. The Software Engineering helps in fostering quality into Software Development and habit of continuously improving quality.

System Engineering.</br>
</strong></br>
      <p>The system is a set of parts interconnected in such a way as to achieve a common objective. System Engineering begins by defining world view, subsequently focussing on a specific domain such as business or product. The domain is further sub-divided into elements where technical activities are undertaken using relevant engineering disciplines. If the domain is business then technical activities are undertaken using Software Engineering. On the other hand, if the domain is construction then technical activities are undertaken using civil Engineering. Thus, System Engineering is a wider term.
      </p>
As per handbook of NASA on System Engineering, “System Engineering is an approach of building design, development, and operation of the systems. It entails identification of system goals, building alternative system design concepts, their performance, selecting and implementing the best design, verifying that design is properly constructed and integrated. Finally, carrying out evaluation post-system implementation to see how well the system meets its goals.”

  <h6 style="color: #FF5733;">Critical Thinking Question</h6>

How will the customers examine if the delivered system meets its goals? Which is the most important aspect to check among outputs and outcomes? 

It is clear that System Engineering integrates people, processes, and products (technology) and constitutes a structured development process that starts from conceptualization and goes till operation. It considers business and technical requirements of all the stakeholders and proceeds further with the goal to provide a quality product which meets their requirements. The processes of System Engineering are as shown in Fig.

Wrapping it up.
</strong></br>
<p>
  There are three myths at the level of developers. They generally think that they are artists. It is not true, development is engineering. However, other myths are as follows:
  <br></br>
  <strong style="color: #07F4D4;">• Delivery of source code marks the end of the project:</strong><br></br>
   It is untrue, successful Software remain in use for several decades. The developers have to maintain them by adding new requirements, repairing existing bugs and preventing breakdowns. System maintenance can be 70% of the development cost.   
   
   <strong style="color: #07F4D4;">• Quality of the program code decides project success:</strong><br></br>
    Programs alone do not decide the quality of Software. In the maintenance phase, documentation and configuration information are also required, besides, comments in programs. Developers also need design documents and test results to maintain Software.

    <strong style="color: #07F4D4;">• Quality cannot be judged till program starts running:</strong><br></br>
    It is not true. There are static techniques to evaluate the qualities of Software. Review and walkthrough can be performed to check the quality of Software. It involves checking the Software Requirement Specification document, design document, test cases, and code.
  It is important to know about the myths that are associated with Software Development, but it is equally important to understand the activities which are performed during the life cycle of a Software Development project. It is also prudent to know what the quantum of cost associated with each activity is? So, all the concepts related to Software Development are explained in the subsequent sections.
